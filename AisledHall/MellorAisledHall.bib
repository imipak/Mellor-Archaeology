	abstract	= "Burmington Manor is a stone-walled aisled manor house with a timber arcade and timber posts for the central truss of the open hall. It also includes a high end first-floor chamber lit by a twelfth-century stone window. Its date has hitherto been uncertain, but has now been determined as 1194/5d. This was a little later than expected from its primitive carpentry. The main discovery from our further examination is that the central arcade posts are in two parts, the upper sections tenoned into sockets in the top of the capitals. The high end chamber was previously thought to be contained within a crosswing; this is now uncertain and the building may have continued in line with the twelfth-century window in a dormer. The unusual face-splayed scarf joint in the arcade plate has also been closely examined.",

	abstract	= "A new survey of Scolland's Hall in Richmond Castle identifies it as an early example of an integrated hall, chamber and garderobe. The hall was entered at one corner and the entrance to the chamber was at the opposite corner, suggesting that it had a low end and high end of the conventional form better known from buildings of the thirteenth century and later. The chamber was relatively small and had a mural fireplace set in the middle of the longer wall. It had a door to a projecting balcony, while a further balcony was provided overlooking the River Swale alongside the undercroft. The building is dated to the 1080s. It is argued that the features which appear to be unusual at Scolland’s Hall – the location of the hall at first-floor level, the organization into a low and high end, the integration of the hall and chamber, and the use of viewing balconies – have parallels in other near-contemporary buildings.",

	abstract	= "The concept of the first-floor hall was introduced in 1935, but Blair's paper of 1993 cast doubt on many of those buildings which had been identified as such. Following the recognition of Scolland’s Hall, Richmond Castle as an example of a hall at first-floor level, the evidence for buildings of this type is reviewed (excluding town houses and halls in the great towers of castles, where other issues apply). While undoubtedly a number of buildings have been mistakenly identified as halls, there is a significant group of structures which there are very strong grounds to classify as first-floor halls. The growth of masonry architecture in elite secular buildings, particularly after the Norman Conquest, allowed halls to be constructed on the first floor. The key features of these are identified and the reasons for constructing the hall at this level – prestige and security – are recognized. The study of these buildings allows two further modifications to the Blair thesis: in some houses, halls and chambers were integrated in a single block at an early date, and the basic idea of the medieval domestic plan was already present by the late eleventh century.",
